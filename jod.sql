Who can give them\nwords of eternal life? It is not in the power of man to do it; but\nwhen the Lord gives His Spirit to a person, or to a people, they can\nthen hear, believe, and be instructed. An Elder of Israel may preach\nthe principles of the Gospel, from first to last, as they were taught\nto him, to a congregation ignorant of them; but if he does not do it\nunder the influence of the Spirit of the Lord, he cannot enlighten\nthat congregation on those principles, it is impossible. Job said that,\n&ldquo;There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth\nthem understanding.&rdquo; Unless we enjoy that understanding in this\nprobation, we cannot grow or increase, we cannot be made acquainted\nwith the principles of truth and righteousness so as to become\nexalted. Admit that the Spirit of the Lord should give us\nunderstanding, what would it prove to us? It would prove to me, at\nleast, and what I may safely say to this congregation, that Zion is\nhere. Whenever we are disposed to give ourselves perfectly to\nrighteousness, to yield all the powers and faculties of the soul\n(which is the spirit and the body, and it is there where righteousness\ndwells); when we are swallowed up in the will of Him who has called\nus; when we enjoy the peace and the smiles of our Father in Heaven,\nthe things of His Spirit, and all the blessings we are capacitated to\nreceive and improve upon, then are we in Zion, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">that is Zion</span>.

Has any being in heaven or on earth\ndone aught to prevent you from becoming so blessed? No, but why the\npeople are not so privileged I will leave you to judge.

Is there any individual within\nthe sound of my voice today, that has received the Holy Ghost through\nthe principles of the Gospel, and at the same time has not received a\nlove for them? I will answer that question. Wait and see who it is\nthat falls out by the way; who it is in whom the seed of truth has\nbeen sown, but has not taken root; and then you will know the\nindividuals who have received the truth, but have never received a\nlove of it&mdash;they do not love it for itself.

If this people would be\ncareful not to do anything to displease the spirits of those who have\nlived on the earth, and have been justified, and have gone to rest,\nand would so conduct themselves, that no reasonable being upon the\nface of the earth could find fault with them, what kind of society\nshould we have? Why every man\'s mouth would be filled with blessings,\nevery man\'s hand would be put forth to do good, and every woman and\nchild in all their intercourse would be praising God, and blessing\neach other.

I live and walk in Zion every day, and so\ndo thousands of others in this Church and kingdom, they carry Zion\nwith them, they have one of their own, and it is increasing, growing,\nand spreading continually.

You\nhave read, in the Scriptures, that the children of men will be judged\naccording to their works, whether they be good or bad. If a man\'s days\nbe filled up with good works, he will be rewarded accordingly. On the\nother hand, if his days be filled up with evil actions, he will\nreceive according to those acts. This proves that we are in a state of\nexaltation, it proves that we can add to our knowledge, wisdom, and\nstrength, and that we can add power to every attribute that God has\ngiven us. When will the people realize that this is the period of time\nin which they should commence to lay the foundation of their\nexaltation for time and eternity, that this is the time to conceive,\nand bring forth from the heart fruit to the honor and glory of God, as\nJesus did&mdash;grow as he did from the child, become perfect, and be\nprepared to be raised to salvation? You will find that this probation\nis the place to increase upon every little we receive, for the Lord\ngives line upon line to the children of men.

The\nphilosophers of the world will concede that the elements of which you\nand I are composed are eternal, yet they believe that there was a time\nwhen there was no God. They cannot comprehend how it is that God can\nbe eternal. Let me ask this congregation, Can you realize the eternity\nof your own existence? Can you realize that the intelligence which you\nreceive is eternal? I can comprehend this, just as well as I can that\nI am now in possession of it. It is as easy for me to comprehend that\nit will exist eternally, as that anything else will. I wish to impress\nupon your minds the reality that when the body which is organized for\nintelligence to dwell in, dies, and returns to its mother earth, all\nthe feelings, sensibilities, faculties, and powers of the spirit are\nstill alive, they never die, but in the absence of the body are more\nacute. They are organized for an eternal existence. If this\ncongregation could comprehend that the intelligence that is in them is\neternal in its nature and existence; if they could realize that when\nSaints pass through the veil, they are not dead, but have been laying\nthe foundation in these tabernacles for exaltation, laying the\nfoundation to become Gods, even the sons of God, and for crowns which\nthey will yet receive&mdash;they would receive the truth in the love of it,\nlive by it, and continue in it, until they receive all knowledge and\nwisdom, until they grow into eternity, and have the veil taken from\nbefore their eyes, to behold the handiworks of God among all people,\nHis goings forth among the nations of the earth, and to discover the\nrule and law by which He governs. Then could they say of a truth, We\nacknowledge the hand of God in all things, all is right, Zion is here,\nin our own possession.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nI have thus summed up, in a broken manner, that which I desired to\nspeak.

If these individuals are dead, in the sense\nthat the human body dies, then there is no communication from them.\nThis we know, because of our own observation and experience.

The\nJews once had the Gospel, with its Apostleship, powers, and blessings\noffered unto them, but they rejected it as a people, and for this\nreason it was taken from them, and thus many generations of them have\nbeen born, and have lived and died without it.

In seeking to obtain\nauthority to preach, all I had to do, generally, was to send my\ncard&mdash;John Taylor, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">du</span> (from) <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Deseret</span>.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nWe are becoming notorious in the eyes of the nations; and the time is\nnot far distant when the kings of the earth will be glad to come to\nour Elders to ask counsel to help them out of their difficulties; for\ntheir troubles are coming upon them like a flood, and they do not know\nhow to extricate themselves.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nI will here give a short history of some of my proceedings. I was\nappointed to go to France some years ago, in company with some of the\nTwelve, who were appointed to go to other places. The First Presidency\nasked us if we would go. Yes, was the reply; we can go anywhere, for\nif we cannot do little things like these, I don\'t know what else we\ncan do. Some people talk about doing great things; but it is not a\ngreat thing to travel a little, or to preach a little. I hear some of\nour Elders saying, sometimes, that they are going to do great\nthings&mdash;to be rulers in the kingdom of God, Kings and Priests to the\nMost High, and are again to exalt thousands of others to thrones, prin<div class=\"hyphen\">-</div>\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">\n<a name=\"20a\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0020.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;20a] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1891\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>cipalities, and powers, in the eternal worlds; but we\ncannot get them out of their nests, to travel a few miles here.

We had a pretty hard time\nin crossing the plains, and I should not recommend people to go so\nlate in the season as we did. We should have lost all our horses, but\nthe hand of God was over us for our good; He delivered us out of all\nour dangers, and took us through safely. When we got to the Missouri\nRiver, the ice was running very strong, so that it was impossible to\nferry; but in one night the river froze over, and we passed over as on\na bridge, in perfect safety; but as soon as the last team was over,\nthe ice again removed. Thus the Lord favored us in our extremities.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nYou may inquire, how did you get along preaching? The best way that we\ncould, the same as we always do. We went to work (at least I did) to\ntry to learn the language a little. I went into the city of Boulogne,\nand I obtained permission there from the mayor to preach; this I was\nunder the necessity of doing. At that time, I had not been very\nparticular in seeking recommends as I went along; but I had a\nrecommend from Governor Young: he told the folks I was an honorable\nman, and signed his name to it as the Governor of the Territory of\nUtah, and Willard Richards as Secretary. I told the mayor, in relation\nto these matters, I had not many papers with me, but I had one that I\nobtained from the Governor of the state I came from. &ldquo;O,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;Mr.\nTaylor, this is very good indeed, won\'t you leave it with me, and if\nanybody finds any fault, I shall have it to refer to.&rdquo;\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nSeveral Protestant priests from England commenced to annoy us, and<div class=\"columnbreak\">\n<a name=\"20b\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0020.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;20b] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1891\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>\nwanted to create a disturbance in the meeting, but I would not allow\nit, besides I was in a strange city, and was received courteously by\nthe mayor, and wished my meeting to be orderly. These insolent men\ncame to create disturbance in our meetings, but seeing they could not\nget a chance of speaking inside the doors, they followed me in the\nstreets, asking me questions as I walked along. Among the questions,\nthey said something about &ldquo;Joe Smith.&rdquo; Says I, &ldquo;Who are you talking\nabout? I was well acquainted with Mr. Joseph Smith; he was a\ngentleman, and would not treat a stranger as you do me.&rdquo; They still,\nhowever, dogged after me, asking me more questions. I told them, I did\nnot wish to talk with men of their caste. They finally sent me a\nchallenge, and we had a discussion; the result of it you may have read\nas published. The Methodist preacher denied his calling, and was to be\nremoved from his place, in consequence; and the others sunk into\nforgetfulness&mdash;I could obtain no information of them when last there. I\ndecreed, then, I would let the English alone, and turn to the French.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nI went from there right into the city of Paris, and commenced\ntranslating the Book of Mormon, with brother Bolton to assist me. We\nbaptized a few; some of them men of intelligence and education, and\ncapable of assisting us in the work. Brother Pack went to Calais, and\nraised a small Church there. We afterwards united some English\nBranches, Boulogne en France, to it, called the Jersey Islands. There\nthe people speak half English, half French; and brother Pack went to\npreside over them. Brother Bolton and I remained principally in Paris,\nand in that neighborhood; we there organized a Church.

[The Book was produced, which was beautifully\nbound.] This is the Book of Mormon, translated into the French\nlanguage, and it is got up in as good a style as any book that was\never published, whether in the Church or out of it. The translation is\ngood, the printing is good, and the paper is good. I have made some\nlittle alterations, that is, I have marked the paragraphs, and\nnumbered them, so as to tell where to refer to, when you wish to do\nso; and in some instances where the paragraphs are very long, I have\ndivided them.

We also\npublish there a paper called &ldquo;L\'Etoile du Deseret&rdquo; (The Star of\nDeseret). It is got up in good style, and printed in new type. It is\nalso stereotyped, and most of it is new matter. I have given an\naccount of the organization of the Church, and a brief history of it;\nof the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, and the evidences of it; of\nthe doctrines of the Church, and the position of things in this\ncountry, &amp;c., &amp;c.

Instead of filling it with the news of the day, we have\nfilled it with all that is good for the people to read, that it may be\na standing work for years to come. It contains articles written on\nbaptism, the Gift of the Holy Ghost, the necessity of gathering\ntogether, and all the leading points associated with the religion we\nbelieve in, that there may be evidence forthcoming at anytime and\nplace, in the hands of the inquirer. If men should be there, not\nacquainted with the language, and individuals should make inquiries of\nthem relating to the doctrines of their religion, they have nothing to\ndo but hand them this Number or that Number of the &ldquo;Star of Deseret,&rdquo;\ncontaining the information they wish. This will save them a great deal\nof trouble in talking.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nWe found many difficulties to combat, for it is not an easy thing to\ngo into France and learn to talk French well; but at the same time, if\na man sets to work in good earnest, he can do it.

The fact is, the men care little about\nit themselves. You will find nothing but women in the places of\nworship there, while on the other hand, if you go out to the public\npromenades, and theaters, and public amusements on Sunday, you will\nsee men by thousands; and if you judge of their religion by their\nactions, you would consider that the theater and public amusements are\ntheir places of worship; at the same time, that the Church is the\nplace to do penance, and that the women do it.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nI am not surprised that infidelity should prevail in such countries. I\ndeclare, personally, if I could see nothing better than what is called\nChristianity there, I would be an infidel too; and I say the same also\nin regard to Protestantism. The Protestants talk a great deal about\nCatholic priests, but I believe they are much more honest in the sight\nof man, and will do more for their pay, than any Protestant minister\nyou can find. You will find them up at five o\'clock in the morning,\nsaying mass, and attending to what they consider are their religious\nduties&mdash;visiting the sick, and going among fevers and plagues, where\nProtestant ministers dare not go. This is my notion of that. (A voice\nin the stand&mdash;The children are always lazier than their daddy.) The\nidea of taking Protestantism among the French people is nonsense, for\none Catholic priest could prevail over fifty Protestants. The Catholic\npriests are more intelligent, they know the basis upon which their\nchurch is founded, and they can reason upon principles the Protestants\ncannot enter into. Protestants can do very well when they have got a\nmass of their own people around them.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nWhen I was in Boulogne, some Protestant ministers were afraid lest I\nshould make a division among them; they were fearful lest I should\nshow\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">\n<a name=\"23a\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0023.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;23a] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1888\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>up some of their follies, and the Catholics should laugh\nat them. One of these Jesuit priests came to me; he was a well\neducated man. In speaking on those discussions, says he, when they ask\nabout the character of your founders, just examine into theirs, and I\nwill furnish you all the testimony you want. I told him I was much\nobliged to him, but I could attend to my own business. I thought if I\ncould not get along, and defend &ldquo;Mormonism&rdquo; without the help of a\nJesuit priest, it was a poor case.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nI was speaking, awhile ago, about the people there being divided into\nthree classes. One of them you may call infidel, under the head of\nSocialism, Fourierism, and several other isms. Communism is a specimen\nof the same thing, and they call it religion! These are generally\nknown under the head of what is called Rouges, or Red Republicans.\nThere is one class that think it is necessary to sustain religions as\na national policy, to subdue the minds of the people, and make them\neasier to govern. The third class is in the minority a long way; it is\nthose who are actually sincere in their religion.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nI will give you a specimen of Protestantism as I witnessed it in a\ngrand anniversary Bible Society meeting in Paris. There were some of\nthe most notable men in Paris going to preach there and that attracted\nthe attention of the public. The meeting was held in one of the\nprincipal Protestant churches. The late Prime Minister of Louis\nPhilippe, Monsieur Guizot, presided, and many other eminent men were\npresent. M. Guizot is a man of great ability, and quite an orator, so\nthat all parties respected him on account of his talent. As he was\ngoing to be there, and deliver a speech, it attracted quite an\naudience. I went to hear them, in company with a French minister that\nwas baptized there. The place was pretty well crowded, not so<div class=\"columnbreak\">\n<a name=\"23b\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0023.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;23b] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1888\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div> full as\nthis hall is this morning; but in that country it was considered a\nfirst rate congregation. When M. Guizot finished his discourse, about\none-third of the congregation left. I thought this a curious\nproceeding; they don\'t act so in Protestant countries. Another got up\nto speak, and when he had made a speech, another third of what was\nleft, left the house and went away; and when four or five of them had\nmade speeches, there were about as many left in the house as you would\nsee at a Catholic chapel at mass. I was really surprised at the\nindifference and carelessness manifested.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nThis was at the anniversary of a Bible Society in the city of Paris,\nwhere some of the most notable men gathered together. I speak of this\nto represent to you the position of things there, and the spirit of\nthe people in relation to these matters. In a theater, or in any\npublic spectacle, all would have stayed till the last.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nIt is among this people we have got to introduce the Gospel. When they\ncome to see it, they rejoice in it, but we do not preach religion much\nto them, for a great many of them are philosophers, and, of course, we\nmust be philosophers too, and make it appear that our philosophy is\nbetter than theirs, and then show them that religion is at the bottom\nof it. It would be nonsense to talk about justification by faith: they\nwould say it was moonshine, or something else. You have got to talk\ncommon sense, you have got to affect their bodies as well as their\nsouls, for they believe they are possessed of both. When they once get\ninterested in the work of God, and get the Spirit of God, they rejoice\nexceedingly in the blessings of the Gospel. I have seen Saints in that\ncountry who rejoiced and thanked God, for the blessings of the new and\neverlasting covenant, as much as ever I saw Saints in any country.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">\n<a name=\"24a\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0024.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;24a] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1887\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nI had thought, after having completed the translation of the\nBook of Mormon into the French language, in which I was assisted by\nbrother Bolton, of returning home last year, but I met with the\nEpistle of the First Presidency, from which I could learn their desire\nthat we should stay another year. I, therefore, thought I would alter\nmy course immediately, and follow the directions of the Spirit of\nGod&mdash;for I wished all the time, as Paul says, to be obedient to the\nheavenly calling; I wished at all times to pursue the course the\nSpirit of the Lord should dictate. I knew it would dictate them right,\nthough I did not see at that time that it would be of much benefit for\nme to stay long there, as it was no place for preaching in. The\ngovernment, after studying about these things some time, denied us the\nprivilege of preaching; and all the place we had to meet in was a\nprivate room; and, according to a law of the government, if more than\ntwenty persons were known to meet together they were in danger of\nbeing put in prison. The officers were continually on the alert, and\nwhen we would meet, lest there should be more than twenty people, they\nwould be counting how many there were in the room, and thus the Saints\nwere continually under the spirit of fear of the authorities. It is\nunder these circumstances we have had to labor.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nAs it stated in the Epistle, that it was better for the brethren to\nextend their labors to other nations, it immediately occurred to my\nmind to go to Germany, so I made a plan before I got up in the\nmorning, for thought flows quickly, you know.

There was one brother in France, who\nwas a German, and was well acquainted with the languages, both German\nand French. I engaged him to go with me to Germany, that is, to\ntranslate. However, I went over to England, and thought we would hunt\nin England to find some person qualified to go and preach in Germany.\nI found many Germans, but none with sufficient experience in the\nChurch. Finally, I thought I would start by myself. When I got to\nLondon, I met with brother Dykes; he had said something about going to\nGermany, but he concluded he had better be with brother Snow, as he\nwas acquainted with the Danish language; he had got his discharge from\nthat engagement, and was on his way home when I met him. This placed\nthings in another position. He said he would like to go if his family\ncould be provided for, but I could not say anything particular about\nhis family.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nI finally had him go for a month or two, for I did not wish to put a\nthing upon him I would not do myself.

I believe the English Bible is translated as\nwell as any book could be by uninspired men. The German translation of\nthe Bible, I believe, is tolerably correct, but some of the French\neditions are miserable.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nA Protestant minister in Germany refused to discuss the doctrine of\nBaptism, because their Bible is so plain upon that subject that the\ndoctrine of sprinkling could not be maintained.

Some philosophers came to visit me in France,\nand while conversing, I had to laugh a little at them for the word\nphilosophy is about every tenth word they speak. One of them, a Jesuit\npriest, who had come in the Church, a well educated man, was a little\nannoyed in his feelings at some of my remarks, on their philosophy. I\nasked them if any of them had ever asked me one question that I could\nnot answer. They answered in the negative. But, said I, I can ask you\nfifty that you cannot answer.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nSpeaking of philosophy, I must tell another little story, for I was\nalmost buried up in it while I was in Paris. I was walking about one\nday in the <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Jardin des Plantes</span>&mdash;a splendid garden. There they had a sort\nof exceedingly light cake; it was so thin and light that you could\nblow it away, and you could eat all day of it, and never be satisfied.\nSomebody asked me what the name of that was. I said, I don\'t know the\nproper name, but in the absence of one, I can give it a name&mdash;I will\ncall it philosophy, or fried froth, which you like. It is so light you\ncan blow it away, eat it all day, and at night be as far from being\nsatisfied as when you began.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nThere are a great many false principles in the world, and as I said\nbefore, whether you examine their religion, their philosophy, their\npolitics, or their national policy, you will find it a mess of\ncomplete baby work, there is nothing substantial about it, nothing to\ntake hold of.

It is good for the\nElders to become acquainted with the languages, for they may have to\ngo abroad, and should be able to talk to the people, and not look like\nfools. I care not how much intelligence you have got, if you cannot\nexhibit it you look like an ignoramus. Suppose a Frenchman should\ncome upon this stand to deliver a lecture upon Botany, Astronomy, or\nany other science, and could not speak a word of English, how much\nwiser would you be? You may say, I thought the Lord would give us the\ngift of tongues. He won\'t if we are too indolent to study them. I\nnever ask the Lord to do a thing I could do for myself. We should be\nacquainted with all things, should obtain intelligence both by faith\nand by study. We are instructed to gather it out of the best books,\nand become acquainted with governments, nations, and laws.

Finding ourselves in our present position in\nthe world of sin and darkness, of ignorance, unbelief, superstition,\nand tradition, which have been woven and interwoven with our lives;\nthrown around us like a mantle, which is used to shield the body from\nthe cold and from the storm; considering ourselves as we are, then ask\nourselves the question, if on earth we have any idea of anything like\na kingdom or community of people being celestial; then ask ourselves\nagain, if we have, does not the presentation this evening border very\nnigh to it? I can say for one, as far as we do know and understand, as\nfar as our capacities can expand, and grasp life and happiness, just\nso far this community which is present this evening, is advanced in\nthe celestial path.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nIf there is a heart here this evening, that does not chime in with\nevery sentiment of righteousness, that heart has no power in this\nassembly.

This proves that the majority, at least, are right; and I have no\nreason to believe that there is a heart in this house, but chimes in\nwith my own. Every countenance is cheerful; every face is lit up with\na lively glow of joy, peace, and tranquility.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nWe are now enjoying our pastimes.

That our minds may\nrest, and our bodies receive that recreation which is proper and\nnecessary to keep up an equilibrium, to promote healthy action to the\nwhole system.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nLet our minds sing for joy, and let life diffuse itself into every\navenue of the body; for the object of our meeting is for its exercise,\nfor its good.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nThis party was gotten up by the members of the Legislature, to rest\ntheir minds, to convene in a social capacity, and enjoy the society of\neach other, with their families, and to give renewed activity and\nenergy, which will invigorate and strengthen them in the discharge of\nthe arduous duties devolving upon them.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nWith regard to these feelings prevailing in our midst this evening, as\nwell as the correctness of these principles, all men and women must be\ntheir own judge. I judge for myself, and not for another, although I\nhave that privilege, and can do it with safety and propriety. Why is\nthis? Because when I look upon the faces of my brethren, I know their\nhearts; let the roots of bitterness be there, and their countenances\nmeet mine, and I know it in a moment. Do you not know it also? Can you\nnot feel it? Can you not see it? You can. This is why I say that I\nhave the privilege of judging others. You have the same privilege.\nHaving this privilege to judge for others as well as myself, I feel to\nsay, that every heart of the company present this afternoon and\nevening, feels to sing praises to the Lord, and shout hallelujah to\nHis holy name. I am in the best place I ever was during my life, and\nwith the best society.

I was requested\nto make a few remarks at the opening of the meeting, but I chose to\ndelay speaking until a more suitable time; for when any of my brethren\nor myself speak to the people, I wish all to hear that conveniently\ncan, because when we are in this capacity, and call our minds\ntogether, it is to reflect for a few moments, and look at each other,\nand think of the Lord; view over the past times of our lives, and\ncontrast their history with the present festive moments. It is good to\nlook upon each other, because the faces of our friends, and the\ngladness of their countenances, cheer our hearts, furnishing food for\nfuture reflection. Under all circumstances, in every situation of our\npast lives, in every transaction of business and of social enjoyment,\nremember it is good to reflect and consider upon it now in the days of\npeace and prosperity, while we have the privilege.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nOur present situation, and the enjoyments of this\nevening, will become\nsubjects of pleasant and agreeable reflection, when we shall be\nseparated from each other. Some of these, my brethren, may be absent\nin foreign lands; our sisters may be separated from this community,\nand go to the right and to the left; then these moments of festive joy\nwill be remembered with pleasing emotions,\nand cherished in fond memory in after years.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nAgain, when we meet in this capacity, it is good for our minds to be\nrefreshed on this wise a little, for the reason, as you are all aware,\nthat we are naturally forgetful, and it is according to the frailties\nof human nature to decline and falter in our feelings at the varied,\nbesetting, enticing, and almost overwhelming temptations that are\nabroad in the world, and with which the people, especially those of\nthe household of faith, have to contend. Our former life, its\nanxieties and enjoyments, are apt to be forgotten.<div class=\"columnbreak\">\n<a name=\"30b\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0030.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;30b] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1881\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div> This is our\nexperience. If we should suffer ourselves to spend our time day after\nday, and week after week, as we are today, how long would it be,\nbefore we would forget the Lord? It would not be long. If we continued\nin the exercising of the body without reflection, this company would\nsoon think&mdash;it is no matter about praying, or asking the Lord about\nanything; we have enjoyed ourselves heretofore, and all has been\npeace, quietness, and good order. But how long would it remain so?\nHow long would it be before we would become careless, if we remembered\nnot the Lord? For this reason, I say, on every such occasion, it is\nright, reasonable, and necessary, that every heart be directed to the\nLord. When we have had sufficient recreation for our good, let that\nsuffice. It is all right; then let our minds labor instead of our\nbodies; and in all our exercises of body and mind, it is good to\nremember the Lord. If it cannot be so, but otherwise, I do not wish to\nsee another party while I live. If I could not enjoy the Spirit of the\nLord in this capacity with you this evening, and feel the power of God\nto rest upon me, I should cease from all such indulgence. From this\ntime, never let us permit ourselves to go one step beyond that which\nthe Lord will own and bless.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nBut I pause here, and for this reason&mdash;I want it distinctly understood,\nthat fiddling and dancing are no part of our worship. The question may\nbe asked, What are they for, then? I answer, that my body may keep\npace with my mind. My mind labors like a man logging, all the time;\nand this is the reason why I am fond of these pastimes&mdash;they give me a\nprivilege to throw everything off, and shake myself, that my body may\nexercise, and my mind rest. What for? To get strength, and be renewed\nand quickened, and enlivened, and animated, so that my mind may not\nwear\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">\n<a name=\"31a\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0031.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;31a] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1880\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>out. Experience tells us that the most of the inhabitants\nof the earth wear out their bodies without wearing their minds at all,\nthrough the sufferings they endure from hard labor, with distress,\npoverty, and want. While on the other hand, a great portion of mankind\nwear out their bodies without laboring, only in anxiety. But when men\nare brought to labor entirely in the field of intelligence, there are\nfew minds to be found possessing strength enough to bear all things;\nthe mind becomes overcharged, and when this is the case, it begins to\nwear upon the body, which will sink for want of the proper exercises.\nThis is the reason why I believe in and practice what I do. The\nquestion might be asked, Why not go into the canyons and get out wood,\nwhich would be good exercise enough? If you would know, come up to my\nhouse, you will soon find out. Were I to go to the canyons, the whole\ncamp of Israel would follow me there; and they would not be there long\nbefore they would say, Come, brother Brigham, I want to talk with you;\ncome, I will chop this wood. How many scores of times I have\nundertaken to work, since I came into this ministry! Scores and\nhundreds of times when my calling in the kingdom of God was less than\nit is now, have I endeavored to set myself to work, but seldom could\nhave a chance to do so more than five minutes; someone would come\nalong, &ldquo;Give me the hoe, brother Brigham, I want to talk with you;&rdquo;\nand so stop me, and no sooner stop me than he stops also. I have given\nit up, I do not intend to work any more at manual labor. I do not\nwrestle, or play the ball; all the exercise I do get is to dance a\nlittle, while my council room is from my office to this room, and from\nthis room to my house again, into my sitting room, dining room, &amp;c.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nYou will see the time, you will know what my labor is.

I will\ncarry all I should, but there is not a person in this community that\ncan bring to mind or mention the time whenever I exhibited one\nparticle of sorrow or trouble to them. I calculate to carry my own\nsorrows just as long as I live upon this earth; and when I go to the\ngrave, I expect them all to go there, and sleep with me in eternal\nsilence.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nBut to return to our party. I would just say, it was gotten up by the\nLegislature to enjoy ourselves. I have enjoyed myself first-rate: my\nheart is cheerful and full of gladness.

When I look at myself before the Lord, and see what He has\ncalled me to, and what He has called my brethren and sisters to; how\nHe has bestowed blessings upon us, and heaped them up until there is\nnot room to receive them, and I should want to go to the gold mines,\nand return again here to speculate upon the Saints, and should be\nguilty of complaining all the time, it seems, if I were to do this,\nthe Lord would damn me.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nI know you feel as I do upon this subject.

O! how would it appear if you\nunderstood the heart of the Lord, and understood the heart and\nfaithfulness of those in the celestial kingdom. As good as we are, we\nshall not want to look upon our past actions; we shall say, O! do not\nmention it, but let it sleep; I never want that to be resurrected, but\nlet it die in the grave, and sleep an eternal sleep.

No, never. And it is on the increase;\nand this is what will make a community powerful. But if we lack\nconfidence in each other, and be jealous of each other, our peace will\nbe destroyed. If we cultivate the principle of unshaken confidence in\neach other, our joy will be full. What does it prove? It proves that\nwe are fast advancing and approximating towards that degree of light,\nknowledge, and glory, and all the principles that pertain to the\neverlasting Gospel, and that we are actually in the favor of the Lord.\nWe need not bring any proofs of that, for that devils never kick and\ncuff their own is certain. As I used to say, fifteen years ago, when I\nwas out preaching, and the people would get alarmed, when the devil\nwould get mad, and would say to me, &ldquo;Oh! dear, sir, what is the\nmatter, I am afraid we are all going to be killed, for all hell is\nboiling over&rdquo;&mdash;my answer was, &ldquo;Thank God, the devil has not forsaken us\nyet.&rdquo; Will he not sustain his own kingdom?

This they may declare in all good\nconscience, and with all soberness. But let me ask, where are the\nindividuals that can say that they know that Jesus lives? And who are\nthe individuals that can say that his Gospel is true, and is the plan\nof salvation to man? I will let Christendom answer this question for\nthemselves; but to me it is certain, that no man lives on the face of\nthe earth&mdash;no woman lives that can say this, except those to whom\nChrist has revealed himself.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nThough others may say in all good conscience they believe he lives&mdash;who\nknows the doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ to be true? There is one\nclass of people, and one only, that live upon the face of the earth,\nwho do know it; and that class of men and women are those that keep\nhis commandments, and do his will; none others can say it. None others\ncan declare with boldness, and emphatically, that Jesus lives, and\nthat his Gospel is true. Upon the plain and simple principle of\nlogical and philosophical deduction, we learn this from his own words,\nas written by one of his disciples&mdash;&ldquo;They that do my will, shall know\nof my doctrine, and they that love me will keep my commandments;&rdquo; and\nI will add, &ldquo;they that know and love me,&rdquo; says Jesus, &ldquo;will keep my\nsayings.&rdquo;\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nThis is my testimony.

That is strong testimony, but it is true. No man can\nsay that this book (laying his hand on the Bible) is true, is the word\nof the Lord, is the way, is the guide-board in the path, and a charter\nby which we may learn the will of God; and at the same time say, that\nthe Book of Mormon is untrue; if he has had the privilege of reading\nit, or of hearing it read, and learning its doctrines. There is not\nthat person on the face of the earth who has had the privilege of\nlearning the Gospel of Jesus Christ from these two books, that can say\nthat one is true, and the other is false. No Latter-day Saint, no man\nor woman, can say the Book of Mormon is true, and at the same time say\nthat the Bible is untrue. If one be true, both are; and if one be\nfalse, both are false. If Jesus lives, and is the Savior of the\nworld, Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God, and lives in the bosom of his\nfather Abraham. Though they have killed his body, yet he lives and\nbeholds the face of his Father in heaven; and his garments are pure as\nthe angels that surround the throne of God; and no man on the earth\ncan say that Jesus lives, and deny at the same time my assertion about\nthe Prophet Joseph.

I wish\nalso to urge the necessity of your proceeding on your missions\nimmediately, and of going to the place of your destination full of the\nHoly Ghost, preaching righteousness to the people; and while you do\nthis, live up to the principles you preach, that you may teach also by\nyour example, as well as by precept. Go, ye Elders, and now consider\nyourselves from this time forth missionaries. If the Gospel is in you\nlike a flaming fire, to be poured upon the people, gather your\nneighbors together, and give your brethren an invitation to your\nhouse, and set before them the duties of man; and preach, if you can\nspeak but for five minutes, occupying that time to the best advantage.\nContinue to preach, study, and learn, by faith and prayer, until your\nminds and mouths are opened, and you understand most perfectly the\nlove of Christ.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nIt is not uncommon for Elders to say, &ldquo;If I could have a mission, and\nbe sent among strangers, I could speak to them, because they have not\nbeen instructed in the way of life and salvation; I could lay before\nthem<div class=\"columnbreak\">\n<a name=\"46b\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0046.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;46b] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1865\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div> the principles of the Gospel, which have been taught to me,\nwithout that diffidence of feeling, and fear, which I experience while\nspeaking to my brethren.&rdquo; It is very true that the first principles of\nthe Gospel taught by the Elders of this Church are easy to be\nunderstood, compared with what it is to preach them to our families,\nor to our neighborhood, and to govern and control ourselves by the\nprinciples of righteousness which the Gospel inculcates. Again, to\ngather the Saints, to preach the Gospel to the world, and convince\nthem of the truth, are much easier tasks than to convince men that you\ncan master yourself, and practice the moral principles inculcated by\nyour religion. That is a small portion of the duty required of you in\norder to obtain crowns of glory, immortality, and eternal lives. I\nwill here remark, that it is natural for the people to desire to know\na great deal of the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">mysteries</span>; this, however, is not universally the\ncase, though it is so with a great many of the Elders of Israel. I do\nnot suppose it will apply to those who compose this congregation; your\nobject in being here this evening is not to hear some great mystery of\nthe Kingdom, which you never understood before.

It is more necessary for the Elders to learn and\npractice upon this lesson in the midst of the Saints at headquarters\nthan in the world; for their facilities for learning are much greater,\nand I will tell you <span style=\"font-style: italic\">wherein</span>. Let a Bishop, a High Priest, a President\nof any Stake or Quorum, any who are Elders in Israel, or any\nindividual Saint from the first to the last of them, fall into error,\nand it is at once made manifest; he cannot pursue that course any\nfurther, for he is where he can learn his duties, and know how to walk\nstraight in the paths of righteousness. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">Here</span> is the place for you to\nteach great mysteries to your brethren, because <span style=\"font-style: italic\">here</span> are those who can\ncorrect you. This fault the Elders of Israel do not fall into in this\nTabernacle, although they may in private houses and neighborhoods.\nWhen a man is capable of correcting you, and of giving you light, and\ntrue doctrine, do not get up an altercation, but submit to be taught\nlike little children, and strive with all your might to understand.\nThe privileges of those who dwell here are greater than the privileges\nof those who are abroad. When your duties call you into foreign lands,\nand you there exhaust your stock of knowledge and wisdom, and you are\nnot in possession of the keys to obtain that instruction which you\ndesire, it is because you are far from the right fountain&mdash;far from the\n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">body</span>, where all the members are in lively operation&mdash;where the eye can\nsee, the ear hear, the nose smell, and the mouth speak, and so forth.\nWhen your face is turned from the body, let mysteries alone, for this\nis the only place for you to be corrected if wrong. Preach the simple,\nunadorned truth; work out your salvation with diligence, and do that\nwhich will guarantee you a warranted deed, an undeniable title to\neternal lives.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"columnbreak\">\n<a name=\"47b\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0047.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;47b] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1864\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nIf you feel prayer in you, pray; and if you feel the spirit of\npreaching in you, preach; call in your brethren, and read the Bible,\nthe Book of Mormon, the Book of Covenants, and the other revelations\nof God to them; and talk over the things contained in those books, and\ndeal them out to your brethren and neighbors; pray with them, and\nteach them how to control themselves; and let your teachings be\nsustained by your own example. Teach your families how to control\nthemselves; teach them good and wholesome doctrine, and practice the\nsame in your own lives.

When the Elders of Israel leave this\nplace and go forth among the wicked, it is not their privilege to\nmingle with them in any of their worldly exercises; for if they do,\nthe devil will obtain an advantage over them, and succeed in drawing\nthem away from the path\nof their duty. For instance&mdash;suppose you and I,\nwith many more of the brethren, meet together in a convenient place in\nthe Valley, and dance to the sweet strains of the violin; we could do\nso with a perfect good will; but if we should be called to England, and\nthere have an invitation to join\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">\n<a name=\"48a\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0048.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;48a] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1863\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>with the wicked in their\npastimes and recreations, and we in our feelings bow down to this, and\nsuffer our spirits to be subject to their commandments, we suffer\nourselves to be ruled over by them, and at once become their servants.\nWhile I am here, I am in the midst of the Priesthood of heaven, and\nin the center of the kingdom of God. We are before the Lord, where\nevery hand I shake is the hand of a Saint, and every face I see, when\nI look upon the assembled thousands, is the countenance of a Saint. I\nam the controller and master of affairs here, under Heaven\'s\ndirection; though there are those who do not believe this. I invite\nthose who are not subject to me as their President, not to contaminate\nmy friends; for were I and my friends to become subject to those who\nobject to us, we are then on the ground of the devil, and subject\nourselves to him they serve.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nNever suffer yourselves to mingle in any of those recreations that\ntend to sin and iniquity, while you are away from the body of the\nChurch, where you cannot so fully control yourselves.

Whatever a man does, let him do\nit in the name of the Lord&mdash;let him work in the name of the Lord, let\nall his acts through life be in the name of the Lord; and if he wants\nlight and knowledge, let him ask in that name.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nYou are well aware that the wickedness of the world, or the apostasy\nof the Church, is so great, that those who now profess religion cannot\nenjoy their own natural privileges in the world.

Let\nus look at the root of the matter. In the first place, some wise being\norganized my system, and gave me my capacity, put into my heart and\nbrain something that delights, charms, and fills me with rapture at\nthe sound of sweet music. <span style=\"font-style: italic\">I</span> did not put it there; it was some other\nbeing. As one of the modern writers has said, &ldquo;Music hath charms to\nsoothe the savage breast.&rdquo; It has been proved that sweet music will\nactually tame the most malicious and venomous beasts, even when they\nhave been stirred up to violent wrath, and make them docile and\nharmless as lambs. Who gave the lower animals a love for those sweet\nsounds, which with magic power fill the air with harmony, and cheer\nand comfort the hearts of men, and so wonderfully affect the brute\ncreation? It was the Lord, our heavenly Father, who gave the capacity\nto enjoy these sounds, and which <span style=\"font-style: italic\">we</span> ought to do in His name, and to\nHis glory. But the greater portion of the sectarian world consider it\nsacrilege to give way to any such pleasure as even to listen to sweet\nmusic, much more to dance to its delightful strains. This is another\nshort sermon.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nI wish now to say a few words to the brethren upon the subject of\n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">tithing</span>. It is well known to the majority of this Conference what\ntranspired, last Conference, upon the stand in the old Bowery. At that\nConference I had good cause to find fault with the Bishops, and I took\nthe liberty to brush them down a little. From that day to this there\nhas been more accomplished by our Bishops in the short space of seven\nmonths, than\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">\n<a name=\"49a\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0049.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;49a] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1862\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>was accomplished by them for the space of years\npreviously. This gives me great satisfaction. The Bishops have done as\nwell as men could do: their conduct in fulfilling the duties of their\ncalling has truly been praiseworthy, and I feel to bless them, and\npray the Lord to bless them all the day long, for they have done first\nrate. When we consider the ignorance of the world, their unbelief in\nGod, and realize that the veil of the covering is over the face of all\nnations, and remember the ignorance we were once in ourselves, having\nto commence like babes at the rudiments of learning, knowing also how\nfaltering men are in their faith, and then look at what this people\nhave accomplished, we are led to exclaim, &ldquo;It is marvelous in our\neyes!&rdquo; Were I to say, &ldquo;Elders of Israel, you that feel to put your all\nupon the altar, rise upon your feet,&rdquo; who would be left? [All present\nrose up simultaneously.] Where is there another people upon the earth\nwho would have done this? I have no tithing, but all&mdash;all I have is the\nLord\'s. You know the word <span style=\"font-style: italic\">sacrifice</span>: as brother Banks said today, it\nis a mere burlesque&mdash;a nonsensical term. No man ever heard me say I had\nmade a sacrifice. I possess nothing but what my heavenly Father has\nbeen pleased to give me, or, in other words, He has <span style=\"font-style: italic\">loaned</span> it to me\nwhile I remain here in this mortal flesh.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nIs it not marvelous, considering the weakness of man, to see the\nwillingness of this whole people to die if necessary for the truth?\nHow do you suppose it makes me feel? Though I may sometimes chastise\nmy brethren, and speak to them in the language of reproof, there is\nnot a father who feels more tenderly towards his offspring, and loves\nthem better than I love this people; and my Father in heaven loves\nthem; my heart yearns over them with all the emotions of tenderness,\nso that I could weep like<div class=\"columnbreak\">\n<a name=\"49b\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0049.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;49b] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1862\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div> a child; but I am careful to keep my tears\nto myself.

I will close this sermon, as I intend to preach another\nbefore I present the subject I more particularly wish to speak upon.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nMy next sermon will be to both Saint and sinner. One thing has\nremained a mystery in this kingdom up to this day. It is in regard to\nthe character of the well-beloved Son of God, upon which subject the\nElders of Israel have conflicting views. Our God and Father in heaven,\nis a being of tabernacle, or, in other words, He has a body, with\nparts the same as you and I have; and is capable of showing forth His\nworks to organized beings, as, for instance, in the world in which we\nlive, it is the result of the knowledge and infinite wisdom that dwell\nin His organized body. His son Jesus Christ has become a personage of\ntabernacle, and has a body like his father. The Holy Ghost is the\nSpirit of the Lord, and issues forth from Himself, and may properly be\ncalled God\'s minister to execute His will in immensity; being called\nto govern by His influence and power; but <span style=\"font-style: italic\">He</span> is not a person of\ntabernacle as we are, and as our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ\nare. The question has been, and is often, asked, who it was that begat\nthe Son of the Virgin Mary. The infidel world have concluded that if\nwhat the Apostles wrote about his father and mother be true, and the\npresent marriage discipline acknowledged by Christendom be correct,\nthen Christians must believe that God is the father of an illegitimate\nson, in the person of Jesus Christ!

When our father Adam came into the garden of Eden, he came\ninto it with a <span style=\"font-style: italic\">celestial body</span>, and brought Eve, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">one of his wives</span>, with\nhim. He helped to make and organize this world. He is <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Michael</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic\">the\nArchangel</span>, the <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Ancient of Days</span>! about whom holy men have written and\nspoken&mdash;<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">He</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">is our</span>\n<span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Father</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic\">and our</span> <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">God</span>,\n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">and the only God with whom</span> <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">we</span>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">have to do</span>. Every man upon the earth, professing Christians or\nnon-professing, must hear it, and <span style=\"font-style: italic\">will know it sooner or later</span>. They\ncame here, organized the raw material, and arranged in their order the\nherbs of the field, the trees, the apple, the peach, the plum, the\npear, and every other fruit that is desirable and good for man; the\nseed was brought from another sphere, and planted in this earth. The\nthistle, the thorn, the brier, and the obnoxious weed did not appear\nuntil after the earth was cursed. When Adam and Eve had eaten of the\nforbidden fruit, their bodies became mortal from <span style=\"font-style: italic\">its effects</span>, and\ntherefore their offspring were mortal. When the Virgin Mary conceived\nthe child Jesus, the Father had begotten him in his own likeness. He\nwas <span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span> begotten by the Holy Ghost. And who is the Father? He is the\nfirst of the human family; and when he took a tabernacle, it was\nbegotten by <span style=\"font-style: italic\">his Father</span> in heaven, after the same manner as the\ntabernacles of Cain, Abel, and the rest of the sons and daughters of\nAdam and Eve; from the fruits of the earth, the first earthly\ntabernacles were originated by the Father, and so\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">\n<a name=\"51a\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0051.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;51a] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1860\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>on in\nsuccession. I could tell you much more about this; but were I to tell\nyou the whole truth, blasphemy would be nothing to it, in the\nestimation of the superstitious and overrighteous of mankind.\nHowever, I have told you the truth as far as I have gone. I have heard\nmen preach upon the divinity of Christ, and exhaust all the wisdom\nthey possessed. All Scripturalists, and approved theologians who were\nconsidered exemplary for piety and education, have undertaken to\nexpound on this subject, in every age of the Christian era; and after\nthey have done all, they are obliged to conclude by exclaiming &ldquo;great\nis the mystery of godliness,&rdquo; and tell nothing.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nIt is true that the earth was organized by three distinct characters,\nnamely, Eloheim, Yahovah, and Michael, these three forming a quorum,\nas in all heavenly bodies, and in organizing element, perfectly\nrepresented in the Deity, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nAgain, they will try to tell how the divinity of Jesus is joined to\nhis humanity, and exhaust all their mental faculties, and wind up with\nthis profound language, as describing the soul of man, &ldquo;it is an\nimmaterial substance!&rdquo; What a learned idea! Jesus, our elder brother,\nwas begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the garden\nof Eden, and who is our Father in Heaven. Now, let all who may hear\nthese doctrines, pause before they make light of them, or treat them\nwith indifference, for they will prove their salvation or damnation.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nI have given you a few leading items upon this subject, but a great\ndeal more remains to be told. Now, remember from this time forth, and\nforever, that Jesus Christ was not begotten by the Holy Ghost. I will\nrepeat a little anecdote.

In the Bible, you have read\nthe things I have told you tonight; but you have not known what you\ndid read. I have told you no more than you are conversant with; but\nwhat do the people in Christendom, with the Bible in their hands, know\nabout this subject? Comparatively nothing.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nI will now again take up the subject of tithing. The brethren have\ndone well. They have been willing and obedient, no people could have\nbeen more so; for this I thank my Father in Heaven. I could not wish a\npeople to work more kindly in the yoke of Jesus than this people do;\nthe yoke grows more and more easy to them. It seems that every man\nwill not only pay his tithing, but give all he has, if the Lord\nrequires it: still I see wherein they may do better. I asked the\npeople today to assist to pay our Church liabilities. The offer of\nthree or four yoke of oxen only, we do not want; but I will lay before\nyou what we wish you to do. By the manifesto which has been read, you\nhave learned the precise situation of the property of the Church. What\nhas incurred this debt? Why does it exist in the shape in which it now\nappears? And wherein could we have obviated the difficulty, and done\nbetter? A fourth part of the money already paid out, did not come in\nupon tithing. This money we have had to borrow in order to keep the\npublic works in progress. You may say, wherein could <span style=\"font-style: italic\">we</span> have done\nbetter, for we have paid our tithing punctually?

Or did the brother who has sent $500 back,\nlet us have $50? No; these have used it themselves, and thereby\ninvolved those who bear the responsibilities of the Trust. Again,\nthose who have not possessed sufficient money to send back for\nmerchandise, have been necessitated to pay out what they had.\nThousands of dollars have been paid here for merchandise. Has\none-tenth of all that money been paid into the tithing office? It has\nnot. And where is the tithing that should have come in from England\nand California. Instead of tithing their money, they have used it for\nother purposes, and paid it in property, with which we could not pay\nour debts. This is wherein we have failed to liquidate our debts. The\npeople go to these Gentile stores, on the Saturday, in crowds, to\npurchase goods. I think we shall not overrate the amount, if we say\nthat $500,000 has been paid, in these valleys, to the merchants. But\nsuppose they have received no more than $50,000 from this community,\n$5,000 of that money ought to have been first paid into the tithing\noffice; and we could have sent it to the States, and purchased goods\nourselves, for one-third or one-half less than we have to pay the\nmerchants here. And $25,000 more should have come into the tithing\noffice from the Church in the United States. The brethren in\nCalifornia have made no less than $100,000; the tenth of which is due\nthis tithing office. For want of this money, we are brought into\nbondage and we must now apply our faith and works to raise means to\nliquidate our indebtedness, which has accumulated by purchasing goods\nat high and extortionate prices. I find no fault with the merchants,\nfor <span style=\"font-style: italic\">they came here to gather gold by the hundred weight</span>.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nNow, brethren, and Bishops, look over this matter, and try to think<div class=\"columnbreak\">\n<a name=\"52b\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0052.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;52b] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1859\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>\nwhat your feelings would be if you were laid under the same\nresponsibility that I and my brethren have upon our shoulders.

Besides all this, see the hundreds who come to us everyday\nto be administered to in various ways: some want fruit, some sugar,\nothers tea, and all want clothing, &amp;c. Then step into our private\nrooms, where we commune with the people, and you will see and hear all\nthis, and a great deal more. Instead of every man bringing his\npicayune, or his sixpence, or his $5, &amp;c., as tithing on the money in\nhis possession, it is all used for something else, and the storehouse\nof the Lord is left empty. Suppose nothing had been put in there but\nwhat the people have put in, the workmen would have been naked. Walk\ninto the storehouse, and examine for yourselves. To be sure there has\nbeen a little clothing put in lately; for instance, there was an old\nsilk dress put in for $40, that had been lying for years rotting in\nthe chest: this is a specimen of the rest. What are such things worth\nto our workmen? Why, nothing at all. We wish you to put in strong and\nsubstantial clothing. Good, strong, homemade stuffs make the most\nsuitable clothing for those who are building up the public works.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nWill you help us out of this thralldom, and have it credited to your\nfuture tithing?

It is\nbelieved, by the religious world, that man, both body and spirit,\nbegins to live about the time that he is born into this world, or a\nlittle before; that then is the beginning of life. They believe, that\nthe Lord, by a direct act of creation, formed, in the first place, man\nout of the dust of the ground; and they believe that man is possessed\nof both body and spirit, by the union of which he became a living\ncreature. Suppose we admit this doctrine concerning the formation of\nthe body from the dust; then how was the spirit formed? Why, says one,\nwe suppose it was made by a direct act of creation, by the Almighty\nHimself; that He molded the spirit of man, formed and finished it in\na proper likeness to inhabit the tabernacle He had made out of the\ndust.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nHave you any account of this in the Bible?

The\ntabernacle has been organized according to certain principles, and\nlaws of organization, with bones, and flesh, and sinews, and skin.\nNow, where do you suppose all these tabernacles got their spirits?\nDoes the Lord make a new spirit every time a tabernacle is made? If\nso, the work of creation, according to the belief of Christendom, did\nnot cease on the seventh day. If we admit their views, the Lord must\nbe continually making spirits to inhabit all the tabernacles of the\nchildren of men; he must make something like one thousand millions of\nspirits every century; he must be working at it every day, for there\nare many hundreds of individuals being born into the world every day.\nDoes the Lord create a new spirit every time a new tabernacle comes\ninto the world?

Just so with us; we that once lifted up our united voices as\nsons and daughters of God, and shouted for joy at the laying of the\nfoundation of this earth, have come here and taken tabernacles, after\nthe pattern of our elder brother; and in our humiliation&mdash;for it is\nhumiliation to be deprived of knowledge we once had, and the power we\nonce enjoyed&mdash;in our humiliation, just like our elder brother, our\njudgment is taken away. Do we not read also in the Bible, that God is\nthe Father of our spirits?\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nWe have ascertained that we have had a previous existence. We find\nthat Solomon, that wise man, says that when the body returns to the\ndust the spirit returns to God who gave it.

I could not return to California. Why? Because I\nnever have been there.

But if we have once been there, then we can see the force of the\nsaying of the wise man, that the spirit returns to God who gave it&mdash;it\ngoes back where it once was.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nMuch more evidence might be derived in relation to this subject, even\nfrom the English translation of the Bible; but I do not feel disposed\nto dwell too long upon any particular testimony; suffice it to say,\nthat the Prophet Joseph Smith\'s translation of the forepart of the\nbook of Genesis is in print, and is exceedingly plain upon this\nmatter. In this inspired translation we find the pre-existence of man\nclearly laid down, and that the spirits of all men, male and female,\ndid have an existence, before man was formed out of the dust of the\nground. But who was their Father? I have already quoted a saying that\nGod is the Father of our spirits.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nIn one sense of the word, there are more Gods than one; and in another\nsense there is but one God. The Scriptures speak of more Gods than\none. Moses was called a God to Aaron, in plain terms; and our Savior,\nwhen speaking upon this subject, says, &ldquo;If the Scriptures called them\nGods unto whom the word of God came, why is it that you should seek to\npersecute me, and kill me, because I testify that I am the Son of\nGod?&rdquo; This in substance was the word of our Savior; those to whom the\nword of God came, are called Gods, according to his testimony. All\nthese beings of course are one, the same as the Father and the Son are\none. The Son is called God, and so is the Father, and in some places\nthe Holy Ghost is called God. They are one in power, in wisdom, in\nknowledge, and in the inheritance of celestial glory; they are one in\ntheir works; they possess all things, and all things are subject to\nthem; they act in unison; and if one has power to become the Father of\nspirits, so has another;\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">\n<a name=\"57a\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0057.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;57a] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1854\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>if one God can propagate his species,\nand raise up spirits after his own image and likeness, and call them\nhis sons and daughters, so can all other Gods that become like him, do\nthe same thing; consequently, there will be many Fathers, and there\nwill be many families, and many sons and daughters; and they will be\nthe children of those glorified, celestial beings that are counted\nworthy to be Gods.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nHere let me bring for the satisfaction of the Saints, the testimony of\nthe vision given to our Prophet and Revelator Joseph Smith, and Sidney\nRigdon, on the 16th day of February, 1832. They were engaged in\ntranslating the New Testament, by inspiration; and while engaged in\nthis great work, they came to the 29th verse of the 5th chapter of\nJohn, which was given to them in these words&mdash;&ldquo;they who have done good,\nin the resurrection of the just; and they who have done evil, in the\nresurrection of the unjust.&rdquo; This being given in different words from\nthe English translation, caused them to marvel and wonder; and they\nlifted up their hearts in prayer to God, that He would show them why\nit was that this should be given to them in a different manner; and\nbehold, the visions of heaven opened before them. They gazed upon the\neternal worlds, and saw things before this world was made. They saw\nthe spiritual creation who were to come forth and take upon themselves\nbodies; and they saw things as they are to be in the future; they saw\nthe celestial, terrestrial, and telestial worlds, as well as the\nsufferings of the ungodly; all passed before them in this great and\nglorious vision. And while they were yet gazing upon things as they\nwere before the world was made, they were commanded to write, saying,\n&ldquo;this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him, that he\nlives; for we saw him, even on the right hand of God: and we heard the<div class=\"columnbreak\">\n<a name=\"57b\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0057.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;57b] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1854\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>\nvoice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father; that\nby him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created;\nand the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.&rdquo;\nNotice this last expression, &ldquo;the inhabitants thereof are begotten\nsons and daughters unto God&rdquo; (meaning the different worlds that have\nbeen created and made). Notice, this does not say, that God, whom we\nserve and worship, was actually the Father Himself, in His own person,\nof all these sons and daughters of the different worlds; but they &ldquo;are\nbegotten sons and daughters unto God;&rdquo; that is, begotten by those who\nare made like Him, after His image, and in His likeness; they begat\nsons and daughters, and begat them <span style=\"font-style: italic\">unto</span> God, to inhabit these\ndifferent worlds we have been speaking of. But more of this, if we\nhave time, before we get through.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nWe now come to the second division of our subject, or the entrance of\nthese spirits upon their second estate, or their birth and existence\nin mortal tabernacles. We are told that among this great family of\nspirits, some were more noble and great than others, having more\nintelligence.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nWhere do you read that? says one. Out of the Book of Abraham,\ntranslated from the Egyptian papyrus by the Prophet Joseph Smith.\nAmong the great and numerous family of spirits&mdash;&ldquo;the begotten sons and\ndaughters of God&rdquo;&mdash;there are some more intelligent than others; and the\nLord showed unto Abraham &ldquo;the intelligences that were organized before\nthe world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and\ngreat ones.&rdquo; And God said to Abraham, &ldquo;thou art one of them, thou wast\nchosen before thou wast born.&rdquo; Abraham was chosen before he was born.\nHere then, is knowledge, if we had time to notice it, upon the\ndoctrine of election. However, I may just remark,\n<div class=\"pagebreak\">\n<a name=\"58a\"></a>[<a href=\"/jod/pdf/JoD01/JoD01_0058.pdf\" target=\"_pdfwin\">p.&nbsp;58a] <img class=\"im\" src=\"pdf.png\"></a><a href=\"http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1853\" target=\"_pdfwin2\"><img class=\"im\" src=\"hbll.png\"></a>&nbsp;</div>it does not\nmean unconditional election to eternal life of a certain class, and\nthe rest doomed to eternal damnation. Suffice it to say, that Abraham\nand many others of the great and noble ones in the family of spirits,\nwere chosen before they were born, for certain purposes, to bring\nabout certain works, to have the privilege of coming upon the stage of\naction, among the host of men, in favorable circumstances. Some came\nthrough good and holy parentages, to fulfill certain things the Lord\ndecreed should come to pass, from before the foundations of the world.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nThe Lord has ordained that these spirits should come here and take\ntabernacles by a certain law, through a certain channel; and that law\nis the law of marriage. There are a great many things that I will pass\nby; I perceive that if I were to touch upon all these principles, the\ntime allotted for this discourse would be too short, therefore I am\nunder the necessity of passing by many things in relation to these\nspirits in their first estate, and the laws that governed them there\nand come to their second estate.\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\nThe Lord ordained marriage between male and female as a law through\nwhich spirits should come here and take tabernacles, and enter into\nthe second state of existence. The Lord Himself solemnized the first\nmarriage pertaining to this globe, and pertaining to flesh and bones\nhere upon this earth. I do not say pertaining to mortality; for when\nthe first marriage was celebrated, no mentality was there. The first\nmarriage that we have any account of, was between two immortal\nbeings&mdash;old father Adam and old mother Eve; they were immortal beings;\ndeath had no dominion, no power over them; they were capable of\nenduring forever and ever, in their organization.
